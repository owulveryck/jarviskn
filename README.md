A keynote interaction based on reveal.js, the annyyang javascript framework and a bunch of code

This is very quick and therefore very dirty code!

TODO: 

* Make it modular
* Clean the code
* refactorize
* write an API for the client/server communication

# USAGE

compile the code with `go build` then set some environment variables and point your browser on the correct address...

say: "jarvis" and it should answer.

By the way, the language is forced to be french :)
